# Lionfish-Trap-Testing
Code and data to replicate analyses and plots for Harris et al. 2023 - our study testing lionfish traps in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

-Research overview-

Deepwater traps offer a compelling market-based solution to control invasive lionfish populations on reefs too deep for SCUBA removals (generally >40 m). A scalable harvest gear must have minimal bycatch, not cause negative environmental effects, and allow for profitable fishing. We tested the efficacy of wooden slat lobster traps, wire sea bass traps, and experimental non-containment Gittings traps with 300 trap deployments on 120 mesophotic (38–78 m deep) natural reef sites in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Time-lapse video monitoring of the traps showed that lionfish were attracted to the vicinity of the three trap types we tested but rarely entered the lobster or sea bass traps. Lobster traps demonstrated more promise than the sea bass traps, whose high bycatch rates suggest they would be untenable for directed lionfish harvest. Gittings traps demonstrated the highest catch rates of lionfish and the lowest bycatch. However, operational issues were also observed, and lionfish catch rates were still far too low to support a commercial fishery. Continued lionfish trap research and testing will be necessary to assess the suitability of lionfish traps.
